# My Cool Project

This is just a sample project to learn **git**.

Stuff to try with this code:

```bash
python star.py

A few good resources:

* [The git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
* [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* [git extras](https://github.com/tj/git-extras)

A checklist:
